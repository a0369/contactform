# Contact Form

This is a simple Angular app that contains a Contact Us form. This Angular app was built with WCAG 2.1 guidelines in mind and also has built-in validation.

This form does not actually submit anything and is intended primarily for front-end use, but it can be modified to include sending data to a back-end server.

## Libraries Used

* Bootstrap 4
* Angular 7

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
